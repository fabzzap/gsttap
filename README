gsttap adds support for Commodore tapes to the GStreamer framework.

With it, it is possible to play common Commodore tape files (TAP, DMP) and to
create TAP or DMP files from an audio stream generated by GStreamer.

The plug-in contains:
gsttapenc - encode an audio stream into raw TAP format
gsttapdec - decode raw TAP format into an audio stream
gsttapfileenc - encode raw TAP format into the common TAP container file
gsttapfiledec - decode the common TAP container file into raw TAP format
gstdmpenc - encode raw TAP format into the DC2N DMP container file
gstdmpdec - decode the DC2N DMP container file into raw TAP format
gsttapconvert - adapts rate of TAP format

The caps of raw TAP format are as follows:
audio/x-tap - format
rate (G_TYPE_INT) - number of time units per second
semiwaves (G_TYPE_BOOLEAN) - if true, a sample is a semiwave, otherwise a full wave
Each sample is a 32-bit number, which is written to the byte stream as 4 bytes
in little-endian format. The number represents the number of time units the
wave (or semiwave) lasts.
